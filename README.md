Threes AI 1.0

Threes AI is a very simple artificial intelligence that ensures it's victory in every game of Threes by manipulating which participant goes first. It implements dynamic programming for efficiency, and always guarantees a victory for itself regardless of the original pile sizes.
What is Threes?

Threes is a variation on the common game Nim. In Threes, there are three piles of specific sizes from which participants take turns selecting two piles and subtracting their sizes.
Rules:

Rules for pile selection are as follows:

    Neither pile can be empty.
    A pile cannot subtracted from itself.
    Larger piles cannot be subtracted from smaller piles.

The game ends when there are no more valid moves. Whoever is the last person to make a valid move wins the game.
